# OG Image Placeholder

This is a placeholder for the Open Graph image (og.png).

To create the actual image:
1. Design a 1200x630px image
2. Use black background (#0A0A0A)
3. Include the Honeypot AI logo and tagline in yellow (#F5C518)
4. Add text: "Halal-first trading alerts that move when markets do"
5. Save as og.png in the /public directory

You can use tools like:
- Figma
- Canva
- Photoshop
- Or any online OG image generator

For now, the site will work without this image, but it's recommended to create one for better social media sharing.
