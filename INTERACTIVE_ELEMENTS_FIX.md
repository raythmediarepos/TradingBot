# Interactive Elements & Tabs Fix Summary

**Date:** November 1, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ All Fixed and Verified

## Overview

Audited all interactive elements, tabs, toggles, and accordions across the entire website to ensure they work properly. Fixed the pricing toggle functionality to properly display different prices based on billing period selection.

## Interactive Elements Inventory

### 1. ✅ Pricing Billing Toggle (Monthly/Yearly)
**Location:** `/components/pricing-tiers.tsx`

**Issue Found:**
- Toggle was functional but prices didn't change when switching between Monthly and Yearly
- Data structure only had single `price` and `billing` fields

**Fix Applied:**
- Updated `/data/pricing.json` to include separate pricing for both periods:
  - `priceMonthly` and `priceYearly` fields
  - `billingMonthly` and `billingYearly` fields
  - Added `yearlyTotal` and `monthlySavings` fields for display
- Updated component to use correct price based on `billingPeriod` state
- Yearly pricing shows 20% savings:
  - Pro: $49/mo → $39/mo (save $10/mo, $468/year)
  - Team: $199/mo → $159/mo (save $40/mo, $1,908/year)

**How It Works Now:**
```tsx
{billingPeriod === 'monthly' ? tier.priceMonthly : tier.priceYearly}
```

**Test:** Toggle between Monthly and Yearly - prices now update correctly

### 2. ✅ FAQ Accordions
**Location:** `/components/faq.tsx`

**Status:** Working properly
- Uses Radix UI Accordion primitives (`@radix-ui/react-accordion`)

**Components Used:**
- `Accordion` (root)
- `AccordionItem` (wrapper for each FAQ)
- `AccordionTrigger` (clickable header)

**Test:** Click on any FAQ question - content expands/collapses smoothly

**Location:** `/components/header.tsx`

**Status:** Working properly

**Modal Content:**

const [billingPeriod, setBillingPeriod] = useState<'monthly' | 'yearly'>('monthly')
```

### Animation Libraries
- **Framer Motion:** Used for smooth transitions and animations
- **Radix UI:** Used for accessible accordion components

### Data Flow
```
User clicks toggle/button
  → State updates via setState
    → Component re-renders
      → UI updates with new state
```
