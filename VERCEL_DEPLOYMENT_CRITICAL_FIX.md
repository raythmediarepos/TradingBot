# üö® CRITICAL: Fix Vercel Frontend Deployment

## Problem
Your Vercel project is returning 404 because the **Root Directory** is set incorrectly.

Currently it's probably set to `//backend` or something similar, which means Vercel is trying to deploy the backend instead of the frontend.

---

## Fix Instructions

### Step 1: Go to Vercel Project Settings
1. Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Click on **trading-bot-7fi8** project
3. Click **Settings**

### Step 2: Fix Root Directory
1. In Settings, click **General** (should be selected by default)
2. Scroll down to **Root Directory**
3. **IMPORTANT**: Leave it **BLANK** or set it to `./`
   - DO NOT use `//backend`
   - DO NOT use `backend`
   - The frontend (Next.js) is at the root of your repo
4. Click **Save**

### Step 3: Redeploy
1. Go to **Deployments** tab
2. Click the ‚ãÆ (three dots) on the latest deployment
3. Click **Redeploy**
4. Wait ~2-3 minutes for deployment to complete

### Step 4: Add Environment Variable
While the deployment is running, add the backend URL:

1. Go back to **Settings**
2. Click **Environment Variables**
3. Click **Add New**
4. Enter:
   - **Key**: `NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL`
   - **Value**: `https://tradingbot-w843.onrender.com`
   - **Environments**: Production, Preview, Development (check all)
5. Click **Save**

### Step 5: Redeploy Again (After Env Var)
After adding the env variable, redeploy ONE MORE TIME:
1. Go to **Deployments** tab
2. Click **Redeploy** on the latest successful deployment

## Verify It Works

After the final deployment completes:

1. Visit: https://trading-bot-7fi8.vercel.app (or your actual Vercel URL)
2. You should see your beautiful Honeypot AI homepage üêù
3. Scroll to the waitlist form
4. Try joining the waitlist
5. Check Render logs: https://dashboard.render.com/web/srv-d3s23ivgi27c739q85t0/logs

You should see:
- ‚úÖ Frontend loads properly
- ‚úÖ Waitlist shows "X spots remaining"
- ‚úÖ Signup works and shows position
- ‚úÖ Detailed logs appear in Render
- ‚úÖ Confirmation email sent

## Why This Happened

**You have TWO separate projects:**
1. **Frontend** (Next.js) - should be deployed to Vercel
   - Lives at the root: `/`
   - Has `package.json`, `app/`, `components/`, etc.

2. **Backend** (Express) - should be deployed to Render
   - Lives in: `/backend`
   - Has its own `package.json`, `server.js`, etc.

When you set Vercel's root directory to `//backend`, you were trying to deploy the backend to Vercel (which doesn't work).

**Correct Setup:**
- Vercel: Root directory = ` ` (blank) or `./`
- Render: Root directory = `backend`

## Quick Reference

**Frontend (Vercel):**
- URL: https://trading-bot-7fi8.vercel.app
- Root Directory: ` ` (blank)
- Env Var: `NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL=https://tradingbot-w843.onrender.com`

**Backend (Render):**
- URL: https://tradingbot-w843.onrender.com
- Root Directory: `backend` ‚úÖ Already correct!
- Multiple env vars (Firebase, Mailjet, etc.)
