## üîë Step 1: Generate Gmail App Password

You can't use your regular Gmail password for third-party apps. You need to create an "App Password".

### Option A: If You Have 2-Factor Authentication (2FA) Enabled

1. Go to: https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
2. Sign in if prompted
3. Select **Mail** for "App"
4. Select **Other (Custom name)** for "Device"
5. Type: `Honeypot AI Backend`
6. Click **Generate**
7. **Copy the 16-character password** (e.g., `abcd efgh ijkl mnop`)
8. **IMPORTANT:** Remove the spaces when using it (e.g., `abcdefghijklmnop`)

### Option B: If You DON'T Have 2FA Enabled

You need to enable 2FA first:

1. Go to: https://myaccount.google.com/security
2. Under "Signing in to Google", click **2-Step Verification**
3. Follow the steps to enable it (use your phone number)
4. Once enabled, go back to **Option A** above

## üîß Step 2: Update Environment Variables in Render

### Remove Old Mailjet Variables (Optional)
These are no longer needed:
- ~~MAILJET_API_KEY~~
- ~~MAILJET_SECRET_KEY~~
- ~~MAILJET_FROM_EMAIL~~
- ~~MAILJET_FROM_NAME~~

### Add New Gmail Variables

Go to: https://dashboard.render.com/web/srv-d3s23ivgi27c739q85t0

Click **Environment**, then add/update these variables:

| Variable Name | Value | Example |
|--------------|-------|---------|
| `GMAIL_USER` | Your Gmail address | `raythmedia.repo@gmail.com` |
| `GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD` | 16-char app password (no spaces) | `abcdefghijklmnop` |
| `EMAIL_FROM_NAME` | Display name for emails | `Honeypot AI` |
| `ADMIN_EMAIL` | Where to send contact forms | `raythmedia.repo@gmail.com` |

**IMPORTANT:** For `GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD`, make sure to:
- Remove ALL spaces from the password
- Use the app password, NOT your regular Gmail password
- Keep it secret!

### Click Save

Render will automatically redeploy (~30 seconds).

## üß™ Step 3: Test Locally First

Update your local `.env` file in the `backend` folder:

```bash
cd "/Users/ramse/Documents/HoneyPot AI/Website/backend"
```

Edit `.env`:
```env
# Gmail SMTP Configuration
GMAIL_USER=raythmedia.repo@gmail.com
GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD=your-16-char-app-password-no-spaces
EMAIL_FROM_NAME=Honeypot AI
ADMIN_EMAIL=raythmedia.repo@gmail.com

# Firebase (keep existing)
FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT=...

# Other (keep existing)
PORT=5001
NODE_ENV=development
```

### Install nodemailer

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

### Start the server

```bash
npm start
```

### Test it

```bash
cd ..
./debug-mailjet.sh
```

Check your Gmail inbox - you should receive the email!

---

## ‚úÖ Step 4: Deploy to Production

After local testing works:

```bash
# Commit and push changes
git add backend/package.json backend/services/emailService.js
git commit -m "Switch from Mailjet to Gmail SMTP for email delivery"
git push origin main
```

Render will automatically redeploy with the new code.

## üîç How to Verify It's Working

### Check Render Logs
https://dashboard.render.com/web/srv-d3s23ivgi27c739q85t0/logs

**Look for:**
```
üìß [EMAIL] Starting waitlist confirmation email...
   ‚Üí To: user@example.com
   ‚Üí Name: John Doe
   ‚Üí Position: #X
   ‚Üí From: Honeypot AI <raythmedia.repo@gmail.com>
   ‚Üí Gmail User: ‚úì Set
   ‚Üí Gmail App Password: ‚úì Set
   ‚Üí Sending email via Gmail SMTP...
‚úÖ [EMAIL SUCCESS] Confirmation email sent!
   ‚Üí Message ID: <...@gmail.com>
   ‚Üí Response: 250 2.0.0 OK ...
```

### Check Your Gmail "Sent" Folder

All sent emails will appear in your Gmail "Sent" folder since you're sending from your own account!

### Test From Your Website

1. Go to: https://trading-bot-dusky-two.vercel.app
2. Scroll to waitlist
3. Enter YOUR email address
4. Check your inbox/spam

You should receive the welcome email within seconds!

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Error: "Invalid login: 535-5.7.8 Username and Password not accepted"

**Solution:**
- Make sure you're using the **App Password**, not your regular password
- Remove all spaces from the app password
- Double-check the Gmail address is correct

### Error: "self signed certificate in certificate chain"

**Solution:**
Add this to `.env`:
```env
NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0
```

(Only for development! Don't use in production)

### Emails going to spam

**Solutions:**
1. Mark the first email as "Not Spam"
2. Add `raythmedia.repo@gmail.com` to your contacts
3. Check the email content for spam trigger words

### Gmail daily sending limit

**Limit:** 500 emails per day for regular Gmail accounts

If you need more, you'll need to:
- Upgrade to Google Workspace (2,000/day)
- Or use a dedicated email service (Mailjet, SendGrid, etc.)

For a waitlist of 100 people, 500/day is plenty!
