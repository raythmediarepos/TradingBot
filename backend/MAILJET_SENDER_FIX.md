# ðŸ”§ Fix Mailjet Sender Email

## Problem
Emails aren't being delivered because `noreply@honeypotai.com` is NOT a verified sender in Mailjet.

Mailjet accepts the API request but drops the email silently.

---

## Solution: Use Your Verified Email

### Step 1: Find Your Verified Sender in Mailjet

1. Go to: https://app.mailjet.com/
2. Click **Account Settings** (gear icon in top right)
3. Click **Sender Addresses & Domains**
4. Look for an email with a **green checkmark âœ“**
   - This is usually the email you signed up with
   - Probably: `ramseytawfik@gmail.com`

### Step 2: Update Render Environment Variables

1. Go to: https://dashboard.render.com/web/srv-d3s23ivgi27c739q85t0
2. Click **Environment** in the left sidebar
3. Find these variables and update them:

**MAILJET_FROM_EMAIL**
```
ramseytawfik@gmail.com
```
(or whatever verified email you found in Step 1)

**MAILJET_FROM_NAME**
```
Honeypot AI
```
(This can be anything - it's just the display name)

### Step 3: Save and Wait for Redeploy

1. Click **Save Changes** in Render
2. Render will automatically redeploy (~30 seconds)
3. Wait for the green "Live" status

### Step 4: Test Again

1. Go to your website: https://trading-bot-dusky-two.vercel.app
2. Join the waitlist with a **different email** (not one already used)
3. Check that email's inbox/spam
4. You should receive the confirmation email! ðŸ“§

## Alternative: Verify noreply@honeypotai.com (Advanced)

If you want to use `noreply@honeypotai.com` instead:

1. You need to **own the domain** `honeypotai.com`
2. In Mailjet, go to **Sender Addresses & Domains**
3. Click **Add a Domain**
4. Add `honeypotai.com`
5. Follow DNS verification steps (add TXT records to your domain)
6. Wait for verification (can take up to 48 hours)

**For now, just use your verified email!**

## How To Tell If It's Working

After updating and redeploying:

**In Render Logs:**
```
ðŸ“§ [EMAIL] Starting waitlist confirmation email...
   â†’ From: Ramsey Tawfik <ramseytawfik@gmail.com>
   â†’ Mailjet API Key: âœ“ Set
   â†’ Mailjet Secret: âœ“ Set
âœ… [EMAIL SUCCESS] Confirmation email sent!
```

**In Mailjet Dashboard:**
- Email will show up in "Latest messages sent"
- Status will be "Delivered"

**In Your Inbox:**
- Email arrives within seconds
- From: "Honeypot AI <ramseytawfik@gmail.com>"
- Subject: "Welcome to Honeypot AI Waitlist - Position #X"

## Why This Happens

Email providers require sender verification to prevent spam. You can only send FROM addresses you've verified you control.

**Unverified sender** â†’ Email silently dropped  
**Verified sender** â†’ Email delivered âœ…
