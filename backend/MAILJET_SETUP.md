   MAILJET_FROM_EMAIL=noreply@honeypotai.com
   MAILJET_FROM_NAME=Honeypot AI
   ADMIN_EMAIL=your-email@example.com
   ```

## 🧪 Testing

### Local Testing (Works Now!):

1. **Make sure backend is running locally:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Or use production backend** (recommended)

3. **Fill out waitlist form:** http://localhost:3000

4. **Check your email!** You should receive a confirmation email

---

### Production Testing (After Render Deployment):

1. Wait for Render to redeploy (~2-3 mins after adding env vars)

2. Go to: https://trading-bot-dusky-two.vercel.app

3. Submit waitlist form

4. Check your email!

---

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### "Email not received"

**Check:**
1. ✅ Mailjet credentials added to Render?
2. ✅ Backend redeployed?
3. ✅ Check spam folder
4. ✅ Check Render logs for email sending errors:
   ```
   https://dashboard.render.com/web/srv-d3s23ivgi27c739q85t0/logs
   ```

### "Email failed" in logs

**Possible causes:**
- Invalid Mailjet credentials
- Mailjet API rate limit reached
- Invalid email address

**Note:** Even if email fails, the user will still be added to the waitlist!
